C++ library for symmetry tranformations commonly used in crystallograpy, depends on wmath.hpp https://github.com/1ykos/wmath

* transformations to asymmetric unit in reciprocal space
* hashing and encoding of miller indices
* calculating offset from ewald sphere
* resolution
* direct cell and reciprocal cell conversions
* transformations in real space is todo but the symmetry operators are already there
